# XcodeTemplates

This is a copy of my custom Xcode Templates.  You can install these templates by cloning the templates to your machine and placing them in the ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates folder.  You will likely need to create the folder yourself.

## Contributing

If you have an Xcode Template you'd like to add, please submit a Pull Request and I will get it in.

## TODO

* Look at submission to Alkatraz plugin
* Add Snippets too.
